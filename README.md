# Day-Planner-Homework
This assignment shows a day planner for an average work day from the time of 9am-5pm <br>
Hours past are made to appear slategray, current hours are made to appear crimson red, and hours yet to come are made to appear light green<br>
Learning Module.js was not too difficult for this project<br>
The most difficult part was figuring out the transitions and making the save function for each time slot work correctly
